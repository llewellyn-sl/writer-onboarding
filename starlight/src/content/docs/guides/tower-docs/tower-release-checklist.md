description: A checklist of documentation updates to complete before a Tower Enterprise release

Tower Enterprise is released in quarterly cycles. The code freeze during the last 4 weeks of the release cycle is used to test and draft instructions and documentation updates for release features and fixes. When features for the upcoming release are confirmed, a number of updates to documentation occur for each release cycle.

## Weeks leading to release

- [ ]  Review release notes Google doc
- [ ]  Write content for new features, updates, breaking changes
- [ ]  Prep Tower docs version of release notes and changelog (enterprise/release_notes/23.2.md)
- [ ]  Compare list of fixes with doc requests backlog to see if any are addressed by them that need a new FAQ / doc update
